## Backstory

This is my attempt to build an open source inkjet printer by myself.

I started this project because I wanted to build a binder jetting 3D  
printer but couldn't find any open source inkjet printer designs.

<br>

Back in 2019 after reading through the build logs  
of the Oasis 3D printer I was scouring the internet  
for anyone's attempt to build an inkjet printer:

-   Without access to industrial production

-   With simple electronics 

-   From scratch

-   At home

<br>

After I successfully built some projects I found on the  
**Reprap** **[Forum]** & **[Wiki]** I started to work on my own.

<br>

The first working prototype I built had a PMMA printhead  
and print - if everything was aligned perfectly - with black  
ink made from thinned out paint.

After that I designed a printhead with internal channels  
that could flush out the air through the nozzles and be  
produced with a SLA 3D printer.

<br>

After some testing and creating single / multi printhead  
builds I wanted to try printing in four colors, that is CMYK.

While I designed all the required parts, I never got around  
to assembling or even trying them out until I attempted to  
write the **[Hackaday]** building instructions.

<br>

At the time I decided to redesigned the project to fit on  
an Ender 3, this however also made me realize that the  
machine was far too unreliable.

<br>

To remedy this, I changed the following:

-   Designed SLA 3D printed piezo pumps  
    to replace the piezo printheads

-   Used MOSFETs + higher voltage for  
    switching the piezos instead of H-Bridges

-   Used a vacuum duct to carry away excess  
    ink that would otherwise block the nozzle  
    with large ink drops.

<br>

With these changes the printer should be ready to do hour  
long prints without failing due to design based problems.

<br>
